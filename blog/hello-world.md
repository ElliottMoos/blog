# Welcome to my blog

I write code for a living and owe a lot of my 
professional successes to the open source community. This blog is an 
attempt at giving back. 

When I found prose.sh on Hacker News, its simplicity spoke to me. I'm a 
big fan of repurposing simple tools into elegant solutions and this platform 
certainly embodies that approach.

A few things you might find here:
- Reports on solutions to software problems I've faced (with no claim to 
perfection).
- Posts about being a software engineer and what that means to me.
- Occasional ventures into the less technical.

You can also find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/elliottmoos).
